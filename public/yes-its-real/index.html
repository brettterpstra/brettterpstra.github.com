  <p>I put up a dummy replacement for the Winona Chiropractic site yesterday. I didn&rsquo;t expect many people to see it, except hopefully the client. It&rsquo;s gone <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?had_popular=true&amp;q=winonachiropractic&amp;result_type=recent">viral on Twitter</a> in the meantime, and I just wanted to verify that yes, it <ins datetime="2011-02-05T01:41:19+00:00">was</ins> real.</p>

<p>I have waited for several <em>years</em> for this client to pay me. I have sent statements. I have been told that it would be &ldquo;taken care of.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t, so I took care of it. That&rsquo;s all. I am not unprofessional, I am fed up.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I&rsquo;ve taken the site down entirely. This isn&rsquo;t really what I want to be known for, and it got a little out of hand. The original site got almost no traffic in the last year, and I didn&rsquo;t expect anyone but Winona Chiropractic to see it, and I didn&rsquo;t even expect that to happen very quickly, given that they hadn&rsquo;t updated it for at least a year. Anyway, Google indexed it, so I made my point, I guess. It&rsquo;s funny how a few thousand hits all at once makes Google take notice of things. I&rsquo;ll let you know if anything <em>good</em> actually comes of this.</p>

<p>For the record, I own and control the domain, the server is mine, and I wasn&rsquo;t paid for the work. There was no hack involved, just me changing a site I built. It didn&rsquo;t say anything slanderous. I just stated the fact that I hadn&rsquo;t been paid. I&rsquo;m not saying it was a brilliant move, but I was at least careful to try and avoid being sued.</p>

<p>For as long as I&rsquo;ve been on the &lsquo;net, I&rsquo;ve never really been known for doing anything mean. Seriously. I&rsquo;ve always made a concerted effort to be nice, albeit sarcastic and a little dry. I don&rsquo;t like the inordinate amount of damage this thing has and will cause; it&rsquo;s disproportionate to any damage to me. On the other hand, this whole thing will probably affect <em>my</em> credibility as well, so it kind of comes out even. Right?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I don&rsquo;t want to get paid, I really do. I&rsquo;m also not saying that anything I said was incorrect, but my method was a little off-kilter. Like I said, I didn&rsquo;t really think that anyone other than the client and a few people I actually knew would even see it. I really should have known better. Lesson learned.</p>
