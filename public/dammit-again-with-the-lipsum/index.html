<p>I know, I <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/textexpander-lipsum-with-kwisatz-haderach/">said I was done</a> with the Lorem Ipsum generators. Then <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/02/dissociated-darwin/">Dr. Drang responded</a> with a brilliant solution which doesn&rsquo;t require Internet access to generate some beautiful dummy text. I set it up and ran it myself, and loved the results. Then I found myself wanting to expand it to do more, such as multiple paragraphs, list items and other things I use regularly when making dummy layouts. The problem is that I&rsquo;m only good for one-liners in Perl, and didn&rsquo;t want to take take the time to learn what I needed to in order to make the modifications. So I redid it in Ruby.<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I used a Gem called <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/raingrams">Raingrams</a>, along with <a href="https://github.com/nex3/maruku">Maruku</a> for processing Markdown to HTML. See, if I had it output Markdown to begin with, I had the flexibility to do both easily. I&rsquo;m posting the main script, which you can modify to output various elements and amounts of text. Even if you don&rsquo;t know ruby, you can probably find your way around with a little guessing. In the section after the function definitions you can take any of the lines and output what you want by mixing or removing those elements.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>This script requires Rubygems, and the Raingrams and Maruku gems. If you have Rubygems installed, you can just type <code>sudo gem install raingrams</code> and <code>sudo gem install maruku</code> at the command line to quickly get both on your system. If you don&rsquo;t have Rubygems, you might want to skip this one, as you&rsquo;re in for more trouble than this will pay off&hellip;</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll also need a text file to pull from. I&rsquo;m using a chopped up version of 1984, with just enough paragraphs to get some good randomness. You can <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/share/1984trunc.txt">find it here</a>, if you want it. Otherwise, choose your favorite text file and make it long enough to be random and short enough to be fast. That might take some experimentation. Put the text in a file called <code>inputtext.txt</code> in a directory called <code>words</code> in the root of your home folder. The final path should look like <code>/Users/[YOUR USER NAME]/words/inputtext.txt</code>.</p>

<h3 id="the-big-script">The big script</h3>

<p>The script should have enough comments to make it relatively easy to dissect and rebuild as a TextExpander snippet for any individual part of it.</p>

<p><a href="http://peg.gd/17Q">Here&rsquo;s some sample output</a>, generated in <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/code/notational-velocity-alt/">nvALT</a>, using <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a> with this script as a shell Snippet, and posted to Peggd. As you can see, it needs some fine tuning. The list items, strong and em could be multi-word, the links could check to see if there was a period-space-capital and prevent overlapping sentences, etc. It&rsquo;s enough for my purposes, though, and between the script and this post, I&rsquo;ve lost over an hour of what was supposed to be a productive weekend. I&rsquo;m out!</p>
