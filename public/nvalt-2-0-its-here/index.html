Please <a href="http://brettterpstra.dev/project/nvalt/">download it here</a>, as the application filename has changed to &ldquo;nvALT&rdquo; and Check for Updates won&rsquo;t work properly. It also uses its own preference files and database now, so you&rsquo;ll have to rebuild your preferences when you first launch it.</p>

<p>This version is no longer my own project. I&rsquo;ve teamed up with <a href="http://elasticthreads.tumblr.com/">ElasticThreads</a>, and nvALT 2.0 would not have happened without him. I got too busy for a while to update with all of the sweet changes that Scrod made to the original Notational Velocity, and things were looking a little grim for a release any time soon. ElasticThreads picked up my fork, incorporated most of my changes with <a href="http://elasticthreads.tumblr.com/nv">his own</a> and applied them to version b4 of the trunk, effectively rescuing me and creating a spectacular release at the same time.</p>

<p><a href="http://notational.net">Scrod</a> already brought great changes like [[note linking]], improved widescreen view and automatic list bullet creation, among a dozen other new features. The following is a list of highlights in nvALT 2.0. See the <a href="http://brettterpstra.dev/project/nvalt/">project page</a> for a complete list of new features.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post a roadmap soon, after David and I have a little more time to agree on the next steps. In the meantime, <a href="http://brettterpstra.dev/project/nvalt/">enjoy the new release!</a> Source code will be available soon, and I&rsquo;ll post the link on the project page once it&rsquo;s updated.</p>

<p>As always, thanks to <a href="http://notational.net">Scrod (aka Zachary Schneirov)</a>, <a href="http://christiantietze.de/">Christian Tietze</a>, and others whose work is a part of this version.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Apparently our build is not particularly PowerPC compatible. Since we don&rsquo;t have PPC machines to test on, it&rsquo;s difficult to provide compatibility for them. Weâ€™ll do our best, but in the meantime its probably best for PPC users to hold off or use this experimentally only.</strong></p>
