		<p><img src="http://brettterpstra.dev/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sushipic.jpg" alt="sushi image" title="Sushi" width="247" height="144" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1638" />This post is a departure from my usual. I need a chance to think out loud about a larger-than-usual decision I&rsquo;m making. Bear with me, or skip it entirely if you like. You can always come back again later for nerdier fun. This morning I&rsquo;m writing about this choice. This is not a life-or-death decision, but it is certainly a change in the way I view the world.</p>

<p>See, I was a Vegetarian for 5 years of my life, and have been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pescetarianism">Pescatarian</a> (I eat fish) for another 9 years after that. I&rsquo;ve recently decided that I&rsquo;m going to eat meat. The beef and poultry kind of meat. I haven&rsquo;t acted on this decision, yet. I thought that writing this out might help me understand my changing views, so here goes.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="why-vegetarian">Why Vegetarian?</h3>

<p>I originally became a Vegetarian because I stopped liking meat. I don&rsquo;t know if it was the preparation, a blood-type thing, or just a distaste for the weight and texture of meat. After a couple of weeks without, a hamburger felt like a huge snail crawling through my system. A Vegetarian diet didn&rsquo;t slow me down. It worked.</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, It&rsquo;s not really about the animals. I do care about animals, probably more than the average animal-lover, but I&rsquo;m what I would call &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; about it. I&rsquo;m not squeamish about blood. I&rsquo;m not anti-hunting.  I understand overpopulation. I understand that the cost of building the living space that I enjoy means displacing a good portion of habitat and that the price is often paid in blood, one way or another. I&rsquo;ve come to terms with that.</p>

<p>That being said, over the years I have become painfully aware of the horrors of the commercial meat industry. I cannot and will not ever eat meat from animals who have been raised shoulder-to-shoulder like plants, fed chemicals and their own brethren,  slaughtered inhumanely  and shipped to my grocery store. It&rsquo;s not my primary reason for being Vegetarian (or Pescatarian); the principles resulting from this knowledge can still be adhered to without forgoing meat altogether. It&rsquo;s just been what &ldquo;felt&rdquo; right for me.</p>

<h3 id="why-pescatarian">Why Pescatarian?</h3>

<p>I can&rsquo;t fully explain why I decided seafood was going to fit into my overall diet. I think I knew I needed more protein than I was getting, and fish seemed benign enough to not conflict with the feelings I had developed about eating flesh. Somehow seafood didn&rsquo;t equate to beef and poultry. I&rsquo;m still squeamish about fish I know are being overfished, and have avoided certain types based on what knowledge I had. I&rsquo;m also generally careful about where my seafood comes from, but not to the point where I wouldn&rsquo;t eat sushi out if I didn&rsquo;t know its origin.</p>

<p>My diet is still primarily Vegetarian, fish is an occasional thing. But I consume it often enough that I can&rsquo;t call myself a Vegetarian. I&rsquo;m also very, very far from Vegan. Really, the only things I don&rsquo;t eat are beef, poultry and pork, as well as a good number of foods that I&rsquo;m just too damn picky to swallow.</p>

<h3 id="why-not">Why not?</h3>

<p>I recently watched several <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> talks on seafood. I&rsquo;ve realized that for every shrimp I eat, dozens more creatures of the sea were being killed and discarded. The random destruction of entire ecosystems is a huge price to pay for a small meal. The most frightening aspect, to me, is that&ndash;from my location in the Upper Midwest&ndash;I have no way to see where my seafood is really coming from, or the impact that its production has. At least with beef, I have the ability to trace the source and understand the process.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really that simple. Once you know something like that, it&rsquo;s hard to see things the same way. I&rsquo;m not John McCain. I don&rsquo;t change my views based on light pressures or a change in wind direction. I am willing, however, to change my stance in light of new facts or new understandings.</p>

<h3 id="why-meat">Why meat?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the local chicken factories. They&rsquo;re disgusting. You can smell them for miles. I have no intention of eating what they produce. Nor will I be eating at KFC or McDonald&rsquo;s (I&rsquo;ve boycotted McDonald&rsquo;s for 17 years for reasons mostly separate from their meat sources). However, I&rsquo;ve also worked on small, independent farms. I&rsquo;ve slaughtered cows, chickens, turkeys and pigs. I&rsquo;ve had their blood on my hands and, honestly, it didn&rsquo;t bother me. I can eat meat from those grass-fed, free-range sources.</p>

<p>Further, and the reason I&rsquo;m mostly focused on beef right now, is that our cattle are almost entirely dependent on us. They&rsquo;re a creation of our own breeding and farming techniques. They&rsquo;re not &ldquo;wild,&rdquo; they wouldn&rsquo;t survive without our intervention. The feelings I used to have about seafood have now transferred to cows. It might just be a mental justification I&rsquo;ve concocted, but it makes sense at the moment. I still do not want to see any animal raised in horrid conditions and then slaughtered on a conveyer belt. I doubt I will ever want to have any part in that.</p>

<p>As a general rule, I won&rsquo;t be eating meat (including fish) at restaurants. Unless they can tell me that they&rsquo;ve sourced their meat locally and can account for its life and death to some reasonable extent, I won&rsquo;t be able to put it in my mouth. There are several restaurants around here which can actually do that, though, and I&rsquo;m kind of looking forward to a steak at one of these establishments. Our local co-op also has a great selection of meats from local farmers whose farms I&rsquo;ve seen, whose cattle I can personally verify is free of growth hormones and other nasties, and whose death I can verify is as humane as a slaughter can be. I&rsquo;m ready to eat those cows. I think&hellip;</p>

<p>Why eat meat at all? Without strong moral objections, I&rsquo;m finding I&rsquo;m curious. I might change my mind after a month of trying it. I don&rsquo;t know. I think there may be health benefits for me, too. I&rsquo;m told a shift in my diet might help the nasty intestinal problems I&rsquo;ve suffered from for almost two years now. Maybe it will be more effective than the $10,000 I paid out-of-pocket for hospital stays and tests last year. That&rsquo;s a lot of money to not have any answers, or even suggestions. Either way, I want to find out. I just need to do it with an understanding of the ecological effect of my decisions, and to eat in a way that helps, in some small way, to create a sustainable way of life on a large scale.</p>
