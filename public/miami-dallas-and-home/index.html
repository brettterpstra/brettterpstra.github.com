is a little spotty, but I&rsquo;m going to see if I can get this posted
from my iPad. Our flight to Miami was delayed enough that we&rsquo;re
going to miss the last connecting flight that would have gotten us
any closer to home than Florida. We get an extra night of vacation,
I guess, courtesy of American Airlines. </p>

<p>I had a great week in the DR and made some great new friends. We&rsquo;re a little crabby about the travel kinks, but I look forward to posting some video/photos of our awesome vacation soon!</p>
