  <p>I just added a <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a> group called &ldquo;Filesystem&rdquo; to my <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/textexpander-tools/">TextExpander project page</a>. It&rsquo;s just a small set of paths that I find myself typing often in support emails, but here&rsquo;s the cool part: they also work in &ldquo;Go to folder&rdquo; mode in Finder dialogs.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with &ldquo;Go to folder,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a keyboard geeks way of navigating in Finder. From a finder window or any save/open dialog, just type Command-Shift-G to get a little dialog where you can type a path directly in POSIX syntax (<code>~/Library/etc.</code>). You can also bring it up just by typing the tilde symbol (~). Tab completion works to a minimal extent, in that it&rsquo;s case sensitive and generally guess wrong if there is more than one possible completion. Handy nonetheless.</p>

<p>With these snippets, and any that you add, you can just type things like <code>~apps</code> to jump to your Application Support folder. I have a few that get more specific, but they&rsquo;re not really general-use, so I kept them separate. The group is more of a starting point than any kind of complete library.</p>

<p>You can download it from the <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/textexpander-tools/">TextExpander project page</a> or, better yet, install it using the url provided there with the &ldquo;Install from URL&rdquo; option in TextExpander.</p>

<p>I also added some new snippets to the Characters set, and made some handy changes/additions to the CSS3 set. For example, it doesn&rsquo;t automatically insert a &ldquo;#&rdquo; in the color field anymore, so you can use RGBA without having to backspace. It also adds a field in that snippet&rsquo;s fill form for &ldquo;inset&rdquo; shadows. If you don&rsquo;t want inset, just leave it blank, but if you do, fill it in with &ldquo;inset&rdquo; and you won&rsquo;t have to manually edit that on all three lines after you insert. There&rsquo;s a new snippet for RGBA colors, and an entire set of Webkit scrollbar mods you can use. Have fun.</p>
