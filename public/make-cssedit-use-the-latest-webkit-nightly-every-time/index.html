In it&rsquo;s heyday, it was <em>the</em> way to edit CSS. It&rsquo;s fallen a little out of repair; it doesn&rsquo;t recognize new selectors and properties (which messes up color coding and completion). Plus, it doesn&rsquo;t play well with nifty frameworks like LESS or SASS, if you&rsquo;re in the habit of using those. My <a href="http://brettterpstra.dev/watch-for-file-changes-and-refresh-your-browser-automatically/">&ldquo;watcher&rdquo; script</a> was my solution to the latter. There&rsquo;s a cool trick, though, that allows you to force CSSEdit to use the bleeding-edge Webkit for rendering.</p>

<p>Quite a while back, developer Jan Van Boghout <a href="http://macrabbit.com/blog/tip-cssedit-webkit-nightly/">posted a tip</a> for unlinking the default Webkit framework and using the one inside of the latest nightly build you have installed. It was a simple Terminal command that you had to launch from the command line, and the effect only lasted for that session. The command eventually stopped working, until <a href="http://macrabbit.com/blog/tip-cssedit-webkit-nightly/#c7970">Ian Beck noted</a> that the location of the frameworks in Webkit.app had changed. It worked with that tweak, but it was still a pain sometimes, even with aliases.</p>

<h3 id="the-solution">The solution</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it took me this long to think of it, but there&rsquo;s an easy way to make the command into a wrapper within the CSSEdit application bundle. This isn&rsquo;t for the faint of heart, and it will have to be done again if CSSEdit ever updates in the future, but it&rsquo;s a good hack for the time being.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to write these instructions to exclusively use Terminal, although many steps can be accomplished through Finder (use Show Package Contents from the right click menu).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the executable folder within the CSSEdit.app bundle:</p>

    <p><code>$ cd /Applications/CSSEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rename the main executable:</p>

    <p><code>$ mv CSSEdit _CSSEdit</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a new CSSEdit file (using whatever editor you like):</p>

    <p><code>$ vim CSSEdit</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Put the following code into it:</p>

    <pre lang="bash">
#!/bin/bash
env DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH=/Applications/WebKit.app/Contents/Frameworks/10.6/ WEBKIT_UNSET_DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH=YES /Applications/CSSEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/_CSSEdit</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Save the file, close it, and make it executable:</p>

    <p><code>chmod a+x CSSEdit</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, when you launch the app, it will run the shell command to unlink and relink the Webkit framework. Note that if you do this on Leopard, you&rsquo;ll need to change the DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH to point to 10.5 instead of 10.6. Enjoy!</p>
