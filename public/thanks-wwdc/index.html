<p>Thanks to everyone I met at WWDC this year and to the friends I got to see for a great time. San Francisco was as beautiful as ever and the Mac and iOS development communities are, as usual, full of new and brilliant ideas. It&rsquo;s always heartening to see. TUAW and MacTech will be posting the result of our blogging work at WWDC over the next few weeks.</p>

<p>The Smile party was a blast, and thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/macgenie">Jean MacDonald</a> and <a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/">Smile</a> for throwing such a great geekfest. The <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/">TUAW</a> bash was a great time, too, and it was great to see some Apple employees show up (happens less often than you&rsquo;d think). They were there with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/danielpunkass">Daniel Jalkut</a>, and it was great to finally meet him, too. Violet Blue, Jim Dalrymple, Manton Reese and more than I can remember right now, great to meet you all!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m headed back to Minnesota right now, and not looking forward to the two-hour drive I&rsquo;ll be in for after landing. Then I&rsquo;ll have about 5 days to get things in order at work, get nvALT 2.1 released and pack before I head off to a family reunion for almost a week. I seem to be moving around a lot for a grumpy homebody. Oh, well.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m sitting and waiting for a tow truck to come start my car right now, and I realize I forgot to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/superpixels">Victor Agreda, Jr.</a><sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> who instigated most of these meetings, kept me alive and introduced me to In-n-Out Burger. Thanks, Victor!</p>
