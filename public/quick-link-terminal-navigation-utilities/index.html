The only problem is that I deal with a lot of repetitive folder hierarchies; for example, the multiple site structures in my web development folder. <code>j css</code> almost certainly isn&rsquo;t going to take me to the one I was thinking of.</p>

<p>I found a couple of solutions this morning. There&rsquo;s a package called <code>cdargs</code> which lets you bookmark folders with short names, autocomplete bookmarks, use bookmarks in copy and move actions and list and visually select from all of your bookmarks. I had some conflicts on my system that prevented me from using it, though, so I went with a simpler solution: <a href="http://www.huyng.com/bashmarks-directory-bookmarks-for-the-shell/">bashmarks</a> by Huy Nguyen.</p>

<p>Bashmarks lets me do most of what cdargs can do, but with a few less frills (and no conflicts with my setup). I can bookmark the css folder in my blog development folder <code>btcss</code>, and one in a client folder as <code>clientcss</code> and be able to quickly jump to the right one. Bashmarks provides autocomplete, too, so typing <code>g bt[tab]</code> gets me to btcss in a jiffy.</p>

<p>On the way, I also discovered a package called <a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">z</a>, which bills itself as &ldquo;the new j&rdquo; (in reference to autojump). It takes multiple arguments and uses them to more specifically match the folder you want to jump to. So, if I have a css folder in /brettterpstra/ and in /myclientsite/, I could type <code>z brett css</code> or <code>z client css</code> to distinguish between them. I haven&rsquo;t bothered with replacing autojump in my config files yet, but this looks promising.</p>
