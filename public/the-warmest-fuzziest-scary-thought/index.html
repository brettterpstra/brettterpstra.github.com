She remembered enough of it that we were able to find it on the Googles, and I&rsquo;m absolutely in love with it. As your end-of-the-day, end-of-the-world thought, and as my I-just-ate-my-first-hamburger-in-15-years thought, I present:</p>

<h2 id="earth">Earth</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>If this little world tonight <br />
Suddenly should fall through space <br />
In a hissing headlong flight, <br />
Shrivelling from off its face, <br />
As it falls into the sun, <br />
In an instant every trace <br />
Of the little crawling things - <br />
Ants, philosophers, and lice, <br />
Cattle, cockroaches, and kings, <br />
Beggars, millionaires, and mice, <br />
Men and maggots all as one <br />
As it falls into the sunâ€¦ <br />
Who can say but at the same <br />
Instant from some planet far <br />
A child may watch us and exclaim: <br />
&ldquo;See the pretty shooting star!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-<em>Oliver Herford</em></p>
