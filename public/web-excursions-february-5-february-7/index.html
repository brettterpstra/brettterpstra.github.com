  <p><strong>Links of interest from <em>February 5 through February 7</em>:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://1aiway.com/nlp4net/services/enparser/">Reed-Kellogg Diagrammer</a></strong><br />It&#039;s SilverLight, and it&#039;s butt ugly, but it&#039;s so <em>awesome</em>. It automatically diagrams any sentence you give it, it with rollovers to tell you what each branch is. I&#039;m having way more fun with it than I did when I was in grade school. Plus, my lexicon of dirty words is bigger, so the sentences are far more interesting.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://code.google.com/p/readown/">readown - Project Hosting on Google Code</a></strong><br />Just stumbled on this. It shows a preview of your Markdown file, and watches the file for changes. Whenever you save, it updates the rendered version. There are a few cocoa apps that give you live previews, but this is the only one I&#039;ve found which gives you the freedom to edit in <em>any</em> app and get a preview every time you save. Neato. It doesn&#039;t recognize .md files (only .markdown, .mkdn, .text and .txt) for whatever reason, but the source is available and you can fix that if you know your way around a plist.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://lifehacker.com/344188/get-only-the-posts-you-want-from-lifehackers-site-feeds">Get Only the Posts You Want from Lifehacker&rsquo;s Site Feeds</a></strong><br />I <em>knew</em> this had to be possible, but it took a note from <a href="https://twitter.com/suratl/status/34315006765961216">@SuratL</a> to get me there.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/02/pleasing.html">Seth&rsquo;s Blog: Pleasing</a></strong><br />Seth Godin: &quot;We can&#039;t please everyone, in fact, we&#039;re not even going to try.&quot; Hat tip to <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewbg/status/34102348129247232">@andrewbg</a>.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://lesselements.com/">LESS Elements: a collection of useful LESS mixins</a></strong><br />I&#039;ve used <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> on a few projects now, and it&#039;s the bees knees. It&#039;s the only CSS pre-processor that I&#039;ve wanted to stick with so far. This set of mixins includes shortcuts for CSS3 properties such as drop-shadow and border-radius. You can cut your cross-browser CSS time down to nothing. Also check out <a href="http://incident57.com/less/">LESS.app</a>, if you haven&#039;t yet.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/index.html">Arduino Tutorial - Learn electronics and microcontrollers using Arduino!</a></strong><br />I now have 2 books and a collection of links for that Arduino I&#039;ve never gotten around to buying. &quot;When I have some free time,&quot; I keep saying&hellip;</li>
