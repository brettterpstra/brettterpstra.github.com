  <p>This is a very short post to mention that I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with <a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a>. I&rsquo;ve been using in it earnest ever since the day Yahoo said they were sunsetting Delicious, and now I feel stupid for not switching years ago. Even if Delicious survives, I&rsquo;d never go back now. </p>

<p>Pinboard does it all, including the full-text search (for a reasonable upgrade fee) that
<a href="http://brettterpstra.com/quick-link-historio-us/">I love</a> about <a href="http://historio.us/">Historio.us</a>. Seriously, <a href="http://pinboard.in/howto/">check this stuff out</a>. The API even directly mirrors the Delicious V1 API, so modifying scripts and apps which work with Delicious is as easy as changing the endpoint.</p>

<p>As an aside, I spent a little time last night playing around with porting some of <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/instapaperbeyond/">Instapaper Beyond&rsquo;s</a> functionality to Pinboard. With the right settings, you can actually use Pinboard in the same fashion as Instapaper, just without the wicked iPad app. It has full support for read/unread and private/public posts. A few extra keyboard shortcuts would make it a dream for &ldquo;postponed reading&rdquo; on the Mac. You can even download offline copies of the last 25 bookmarks, complete with a table of contents.</p>

<p>If you surf the web, you need Pinboard. Do yourself a favor and check it out.</p>

<p>P.S. If anyone from Pinboard is listening, <em>please</em> add <code>fromdt</code> support to the API!</p>
